# Virtual Personal Assistant [Chewie]

Implementation of some kind of virtual assistant on Android phones. It enables to perform some basic actions using simple voice commands (polish language) like calling someone from phonebook, find location on a map etc.

The project implements some fine ideas like drawable head, which supposed to act like record button, or a conversion between polish ang english letters (like Ä™ -> e), though it can not be considered finished.

It started as a project for the university, in colaboration with github.com/MLateralus.
